# War-Card Game

War (also known as Battle) is a simple card game, typically played by two players using a standard playing card deck.

The objective of the game is to win all of the cards.

The deck is divided evenly among the players, giving each a down stack.

If the two cards played are of equal value, then there is a "WAR". Both players place the next card of their pile face down and then another card face-up. The owner of the higher face-up card wins the war and adds all the cards on the table to the bottom of their deck. If the face-up cards are again equal then the battle repeats with another set of face-down/up cards. This repeats until one player's face-up card is higher than their opponent's.

This has been implemented in Python.
